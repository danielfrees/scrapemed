Welcome to scrapemed's documentation!
=====================================

ScrapeMed is a powerful, easy to use, data scraping tool for PubMed Central (PMC) data.
Most users will only need to interact with ``Paper`` and ``paperSet`` objects to build
their PMC datasets, but a complete documentation of ScrapeMed's modules and functions can be found here.
